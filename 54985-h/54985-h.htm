<span class="i2">So six long years he revelled, night and day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the mirth waxed loudest, with dull sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes from the grove’s centre echoes came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell his wondering people of their king;<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">And</span> the first gray of morning filled the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the Tartar camp along the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was hushed, and still the men were plunged in sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sohrab alone, he slept not; all night long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the gray dawn stole into his tent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took his horseman’s cloak, and left his tent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went abroad into the cold wet fog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa’s tent.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through the black Tartar tents he passed, which stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Oxus, where the summer-floods o’erflow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the black tents he passed, o’er that low strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to a hillock came, a little back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the stream’s brink,&mdash;the spot where first a boat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men of former times had crowned the top<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a clay fort; but that was fallen, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>{60}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa’s tent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dome of laths, and o’er it felts were spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found the old man sleeping on his bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was dulled; for he slept light, an old man’s sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rose quickly on one arm, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Who art thou? for it is not yet clear dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak! is there news, or any night alarm?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Sohrab came to the bedside, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Thou know’st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun has not yet risen, and the foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep: but I sleep not; all night long I lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tossing and wakeful, and I come to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Samarcand, before the army marched;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will tell thee what my heart desires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know’st if, since from Ader-baijan first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came among the Tartars, and bore arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At my boy’s years, the courage of a man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This too thou know’st, that while I still bear on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beat the Persians back on every field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seek one man, one man, and one alone,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustum, my father; who I hoped should greet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should one day greet, upon some well-fought field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His not unworthy, not inglorious son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I long hoped, but him I never find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come then, hear now, and grant me what I ask.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the two armies rest to-day; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a>{61}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet me, man to man: if I prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustum will surely hear it; if I fall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim is the rumor of a common fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where host meets host, and many names are sunk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of a single combat fame speaks clear.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the young man in his, and sighed, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And share the battle’s common chance with us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who love thee, but must press forever first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In single fight incurring single risk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find a father thou hast never seen?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That were far best, my son, to stay with us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when ’tis truce, then in Afrasiab’s towns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if this one desire indeed rules all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek out Rustum&mdash;seek him not through fight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek him in peace, and carry to his arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Sohrab, carry an unwounded son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But far hence seek him, for he is not here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now it is not as when I was young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Rustum was in front of every fray:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now he keeps apart, and sits at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Seistan, with Zal, his father old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether that his own mighty strength at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feels the abhorred approaches of old age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in some quarrel with the Persian king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There go!&mdash;Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Danger or death awaits thee on this field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fain would I know thee safe and well, though lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To us; fain therefore send thee hence in peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a>{62}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek thy father, not seek single fights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain. But who can keep the lion’s cub<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From ravening, and who govern Rustum’s son?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, I will grant thee what thy heart desires.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So said he, and dropped Sohrab’s hand, and left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er his chilly limbs his woollen coat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passed, and tied his sandals on his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And threw a white cloak round him, and he took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his right hand a ruler’s staff, no sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black, glossy, curled, the fleece of Kara-Kul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raised the curtain of his tent, and called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His herald to his side, and went abroad.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sun by this had risen, and cleared the fog<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the open plain: so Haman bade,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The host, and still was in his lusty prime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their black tents, long files of horse, they streamed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when some gray November morn the files,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In marching order spread, of long-necked cranes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the warm Persian seaboard,&mdash;so they streamed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tartars of the Oxus, the king’s guard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Large men, large steeds, who from Bokhara come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a>{63}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light men and on light steeds, who only drink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The acrid milk of camels, and their wells.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From far, and a more doubtful service owned,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who roam o’er Kipchak and the northern waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These all filed out from camp into the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the other side the Persians formed,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Ilyats of Khorassan; and behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marshalled battalions bright in burnished steel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Peran-Wisa with his herald came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took his spear, and to the front he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And checked his ranks, and fixed them where they stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the old Tartar came upon the sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let there be truce between the hosts to-day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But choose a champion from the Persian lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As in the country, on a morn in June,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the dew glistens on the pearled ears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a>{64}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But as a troop of pedlers from Cabool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That vast sky-neighboring mountain of milk snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slake their parched throats with sugared mulberries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In single file they move, and stop their breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fear they should dislodge the o’erhanging snows,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Second, and was the uncle of the king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These came and counselled, and then Gudurz said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet champion have we none to match this youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has the wild stag’s foot, the lion’s heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Rustum came last night; aloof he sits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sullen, and has pitched his tents apart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him will I seek, and carry to his ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tartar challenge, and this young man’s name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haply he will forget his wrath, and fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand forth the while, and take their challenge up.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a man.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake; and Peran-Wisa turned, and strode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back through the opening squadrons to his tent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a>{65}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crossed the camp which lay behind, and reached,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum’s tents.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just pitched; the high pavilion in the midst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Rustum’s, and his men lay camped around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gudurz entered Rustum’s tent, and found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustum; his morning meal was done, but still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The table stood before him, charged with food,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dark-green melons; and there Rustum sate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listless, and held a falcon on his wrist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And played with it; but Gudurz came and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him; and he looked, and saw him stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a cry sprang up, and dropped the bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What news? but sit down first, and eat and drink.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Not now. A time will come to eat and drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not to-day: to-day has other needs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, from the Tartars is a challenge brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pick a champion from the Persian lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fight their champion&mdash;and thou know’st his name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Rustum, like thy might is this young man’s!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has the wild stag’s foot, the lion’s heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he is young, and Iran’s chiefs are old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; but Rustum answered with a smile,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Go to! if Iran’s chiefs are old, then I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am older. If the young are weak, the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Errs strangely; for the king, for Kai Khosroo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>{66}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself is young, and honors younger men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lets the aged moulder to their graves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustum he loves no more, but loves the young:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young may rise at Sohrab’s vaunts, not I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what care I, though all speak Sohrab’s fame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For would that I myself had such a son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not that one slight helpless girl I have!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A son so famed, so brave, to send to war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I to tarry with the snow-haired Zal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father, whom the robber Afghans vex,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clip his borders short, and drive his herds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he has none to guard his weak old age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There would I go, and hang my armor up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with my great name fence that weak old man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spend the goodly treasures I have got,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab’s fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And shuns to peril it with younger men</i>.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou knowest better words than this to say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is one more, one less, obscure or famed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valiant or craven, young or old, to me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are not they mortal? am not I myself?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who for men of naught would do great deeds?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a>{67}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let not men say of Rustum, he was matched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In single fight with any mortal man.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke, and frowned; and Gudurz turned, and ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His followers in, and bade them bring his arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clad himself in steel. The arms he chose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were plain, and on his shield was no device;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, from the fluted spine a-top, a plume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of horse-hair waved, a scarlet horse-hair plume.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So armed, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed him like a faithful hound at heel,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horse whom Rustum on a foray once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did in Bokhara by the river find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reared him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dight with a saddle-cloth of broidered green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crusted with gold, and on the ground were worked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So followed, Rustum left his tents, and crossed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The camp, and to the Persian host appeared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the Persians knew him, and with shouts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hailed; but the Tartars knew not who he was.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dear as the wet diver to the eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunging all day in the blue waves, at night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having made up his tale of precious pearls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a>{68}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Rustum to the Persian front advanced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sohrab armed in Haman’s tent, and came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a-field the reapers cut a swath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down through the middle of a rich man’s corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on each side are squares of standing corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the midst a stubble short and bare,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So on each side were squares of men, with spears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bristling, and in the midst the open sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As some rich woman, on a winter’s morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with numb blackened fingers makes her fire,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At cock-crow, on a starlit winter’s morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the frost flowers the whitened window-panes,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the most valiant chiefs; long he perused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His spirited air, and wondered who he was.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For very young he seemed, tenderly reared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some young cypress, tall and dark and straight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in a queen’s secluded garden throws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By midnight, to a bubbling fountain’s sound,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So slender Sohrab seemed, so softly reared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a deep pity entered Rustum’s soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he beheld him coming; and he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beckoned to him with his hand, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“O thou young man, the air of heaven is soft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven’s air is better than the cold dead grave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a>{69}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold me! I am vast, and clad in iron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tried; and I have stood on many a field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never was that field lost, or that foe saved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be governed: quit the Tartar host, and come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Iran, and be as my son to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fight beneath my banner till I die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are no youths in Iran brave as thou.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So he spake, mildly. Sohrab heard his voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His giant figure planted on the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sole, like some single tower, which a chief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath builded on the waste in former years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the robbers; and he saw that head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streaked with its first gray hairs; hope filled his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he ran forward, and embraced his knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clasped his hand within his own, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Oh, by thy father’s head! by thine own soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou not Rustum? Speak! art thou not he?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned away, and spake to his own soul,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Ah me! I muse what this young fox may mean!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if I now confess this thing he asks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hide it not, but say, <i>Rustum is here!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he will find some pretext not to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab’s hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Samarcand, he will arise and cry,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">‘I challenged once, when the two armies camped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a>{70}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cope with me in single fight; but they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then he turned, and sternly spake aloud,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rash boy, men look on Rustum’s face, and flee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For well I know, that did great Rustum stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before thy face this day, and were revealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There would be then no talk of fighting more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But being what I am, I tell thee this,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do thou record it in thine inmost soul:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt, and yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oxus in summer wash them all away.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; and Sohrab answered, on his feet,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fight me so!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am no girl, to be made pale by words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on this field, there were no fighting then.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou art proved, I know, and I am young&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a>{71}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whether it will heave us up to land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or whether it will roll us out to sea,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know not, and no search will make us know:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the event will teach us in its hour.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; and Rustum answered not, but hurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His spear: down from the shoulder, down it came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on some partridge in the corn a hawk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That long has towered in the airy clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hissed, and went quivering down into the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which it sent flying wide. Then Sohrab threw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In turn, and full struck Rustum’s shield; sharp rang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The iron plates rang sharp, but turned the spear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum seized his club, which none but he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could wield; an unlopped trunk it was, and huge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still rough,&mdash;like those which men in treeless plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strewn the channels with torn boughs,&mdash;so huge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum’s hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum followed his own blow, and fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his knees, and with his fingers clutched the sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he looked on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a>{72}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Thou strik’st too hard! that club of thine will float<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the summer-floods, and not my bones.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou say’st thou art not Rustum; be it so!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who art thou, then, that canst so touch my soul?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boy as I am, I have seen battles too,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard their hollow roar of dying men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never was my heart thus touched before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pledge each other in red wine, like friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum’s deeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are enough foes in the Persian host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mayst fight; fight <i>them</i>, when they confront thy spear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh, let there be peace ’twixt thee and me!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He ceased; but while he spake, Rustum had risen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood erect, trembling with rage; his club<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left to lie, but had regained his spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fiery point now in his mailed right hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The baleful sign of fevers; dust had soiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His stately crest, and dimmed his glittering arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His breast heaved, his lips foamed, and twice his voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curled minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a>{73}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art not in Afrasiab’s gardens now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of battle, and with me, who make no play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of war: I fight it out, and hand to hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember all thy valor; try thy feints<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cunning! all the pity I had is gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thy light skipping tricks and thy girl’s wiles.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he too drew his sword; at once they rushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together, as two eagles on one prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come rushing down together from the clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One from the east, one from the west; their shields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dashed with a clang together, and a din<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make often in the forest’s heart at morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hewing axes, crashing trees,&mdash;such blows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustum and Sohrab on each other hailed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you would say that sun and stars took part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that unnatural conflict: for a cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew suddenly in heaven, and darked the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the fighters’ heads; and a wind rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a sandy whirlwind wrapped the pair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gloom they twain were wrapped, and they alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For both the on-looking hosts on either hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laboring breath. First Rustum struck the shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rent the tough plates, but failed to reach the skin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a>{74}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum plucked it back with angry groan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum’s helm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shore away, and that proud horse-hair plume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum bowed his head. But then the gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh the horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stood at hand, uttered a dreadful cry:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No horse’s cry was that, most like the roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some pained desert-lion, who all day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has trailed the hunter’s javelin in his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And comes at night to die upon the sand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Oxus curdled as it crossed his stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sohrab heard, and quailed not, but rushed on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And struck again; and again Rustum bowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the hand the hilt remained alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shouted, <i>Rustum</i>! Sohrab heard that shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shrank amazed: back he recoiled one step,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scanned with blinking eyes the advancing form;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he stood bewildered, and he dropped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He reeled, and staggering back sank to the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw Rustum standing safe upon his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sohrab wounded on the bloody sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, with a bitter smile, Rustum began,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a>{75}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab’s tent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else that the great Rustum would come down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart to take a gift, and let thee go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then that all the Tartar host would praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To glad thy father in his weak old age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to thy friends, and to thy father old.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Unknown thou art, yet thy fierce vaunt is vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, were I matched with ten such men as thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I were that which till to-day I was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They should be lying here, I standing there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that belovèd name unnerved my arm,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That name, and something, I confess, in thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall; and thy spear transfixed an unarmed foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now thou boastest, and insult’st my fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father, whom I seek through all the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As when some hunter in the spring hath found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And followed her to find her where she fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off; anon her mate comes winging back<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a>{76}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hunting, and a great way off descries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His huddling young left sole; at that, he checks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Circles above his eyry, with loud screams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some far stony gorge out of his ken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heap of fluttering feathers,&mdash;never more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall the lake glass her, flying over it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never the black and dripping precipices<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echo her stormy scream as she sails by,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his dying son, and knew him not.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And with a cold, incredulous voice, he said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What prate is this of fathers and revenge?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty Rustum never had a son.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Ah, yes, he had! and that lost son am I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely the news will one day reach his ear,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What will that grief, what will that vengeance, be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, could I live till I that grief had seen!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet him I pity not so much, but her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that old king, her father, who grows gray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With age, and rules over the valiant Koords.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her most I pity, who no more will see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spoils and honor, when the war is done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a>{77}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a dark rumor will be bruited up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then will that defenceless woman learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that in battle with a nameless foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking of her he left, and his own death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke; but Rustum listened, plunged in thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did he yet believe it was his son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who spoke, although he called back names he knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he had had sure tidings that the babe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was in Ader-baijan born to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been a puny girl, no boy at all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that sad mother sent him word, for fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so he deemed that either Sohrab took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a false boast, the style of Rustum’s son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So deemed he: yet he listened, plunged in thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the bright rocking ocean sets to shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the full moon; tears gathered in his eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he remembered his own early youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through many rolling clouds,&mdash;so Rustum saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His youth; saw Sohrab’s mother in her bloom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that old king, her father, who loved well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They three, in that long-distant summer-time,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a>{78}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hound, and morn on those delightful hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Ader-baijan. And he saw that youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of age and looks to be his own dear son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the mown, dying grass,&mdash;so Sohrab lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lovely in death, upon the common sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have told thee false: thou art not Rustum’s son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Rustum had no son: one child he had,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one,&mdash;a girl; who with her mother now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Sohrab answered him in wrath; for now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The anguish of the deep-fixed spear grew fierce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he desired to draw forth the steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the blood flow free, and so to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first he would convince his stubborn foe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, rising sternly on one arm, he said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truth sits upon the lips of dying men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell thee, pricked upon this arm I bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she might prick it on the babe she bore.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum’s cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his knees tottered, and he smote his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against his breast, his heavy mailèd hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a>{79}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the hard iron corslet clanked aloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his heart he pressed the other hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a hollow voice he spake, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou show this, then art thou Rustum’s son.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed a sign in faint vermilion points<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pricked; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An emperor’s gift,&mdash;at early morn he paints,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So delicately pricked the sign appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Sohrab’s arm, the sign of Rustum’s seal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was that griffin which of old reared Zal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustum’s great father, whom they left to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A helpless babe, among the mountain rocks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him that kind creature found, and reared, and loved;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And himself scanned it long with mournful eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he touched it with his hand, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“How say’st thou? Is that sign the proper sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Rustum’s son, or of some other man’s?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speechless; and then he uttered one sharp cry,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O boy&mdash;thy father!</i> and his voice choked there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a dark cloud passed before his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his head swam, and he sank down to earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sohrab crawled to where he lay, and cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arms about his neck, and kissed his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trying to call him back to life; and life<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a>{80}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they stood wide with horror; and he seized<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In both his hands the dust which lay around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And threw it on his head, and smirched his hair,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his sobs choked him; and he clutched his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To draw it, and forever let life out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a soothing voice he spake, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doom which at my birth was written down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Heaven, and thou art Heaven’s unconscious hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know it! But fate trod those promptings down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strife, and hurled me on my father’s spear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let us speak no more of this. I find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father, let me feel that I have found!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wash them with thy tears, and say, <i>My son!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick, quick! for numbered are my sands of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swift; for like the lightning to this field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came, and like the wind I go away,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it was writ in Heaven that this should be.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So said he; and his voice released the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arms round his son’s neck, and wept aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed him. And awe fell on both the hosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they saw Rustum’s grief; and Ruksh, the horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his head bowing to the ground, and mane<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a>{81}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First to the one, then to the other, moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head, as if inquiring what their grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The big warm tears rolled down, and caked the sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should then have rotted on their nimble joints,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first they bore thy master to this field!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Sohrab looked upon the horse, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My terrible father’s terrible horse! and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should one day find thy lord and thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou hast gone where I shall never go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snuffed the breezes of my father’s home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Corn in a golden platter, soaked with wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, <i>O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!</i> But I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have never known my grandsire’s furrowed face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lodged among my father’s foes, and seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afrasiab’s cities only, Samarcand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a>{82}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewailed,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh that its waves were flowing over me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh that I saw its grains of yellow silt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll tumbling in the current o’er my head!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Desire not that, my father! thou must live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some are born to do great deeds, and live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some are born to be obscured, and die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reap a second glory in thine age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But come! thou seest this great host of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me entreat for them: what have they done?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They followed me, my hope, my fame, my star.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But carry me with thee to Seistan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, and the snow-haired Zal, and all thy friends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heap a stately mound above my bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plant a far-seen pillar over all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so the passing horseman on the waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May see my tomb a great way off, and cry,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sohrab, the mighty Rustum’s son, lies there,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I be not forgotten in my grave.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carry thee away to Seistan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a>{83}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heap a stately mound above thy bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plant a far-seen pillar over all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should I do with slaying any more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For would that all whom I have ever slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might be once more alive,&mdash;my bitterest foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they who were called champions in their time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through whose death I won that fame I have,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I were nothing but a common man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or rather would that I, even I myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might now be lying on this bloody sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And say, <i>O son, I weep thee not too sore,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For willingly, I know, thou met’st thine end!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now in blood and battles was my youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And full of blood and battles is my age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall never end this life of blood.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, at the point of death, Sohrab replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning home over the salt blue sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From laying thy dear master in his grave.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a>{84}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Rustum gazed in Sohrab’s face, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wound’s imperious anguish; but the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came welling from the open gash, and life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowed with the stream; all down his cold white side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the soiled tissue of white violets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left, freshly gathered, on their native bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By children whom their nurses call with haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In-doors from the sun’s eye; his head drooped low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Convulsed him back to life, he opened them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fixed them feebly on his father’s face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till now all strength was ebbed, and from his limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwillingly the spirit fled away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regretting the warm mansion which it left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the great Rustum drew his horseman’s cloak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down o’er his face, and sate by his dead son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those black granite pillars, once high-reared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His house, now ’mid their broken flights of steps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And night came down over the solemn waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And darkened all; and a cold fog, with night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a>{85}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of a great assembly loosed, and fires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to twinkle through the fog; for now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Persians took it on the open sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Southward, the Tartars by the river-marge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rustum and his son were left alone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But the majestic river floated on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the mist and hum of that low land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoicing, through the hushed Chorasmian waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the solitary moon; he flowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right for the polar star, past Orgunjè,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And split his currents; that for many a league<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shorn and parcelled Oxus strains along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his high mountain cradle in Pamere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foiled circuitous wanderer,&mdash;till at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The longed-for dash of waves is heard, and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His luminous home of waters opens, bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">So</span> on the floor lay Balder dead; and round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay thickly strewn swords, axes, darts, and spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which all the gods in sport had idly thrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Balder, whom no weapon pierced or clove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in his breast stood fixed the fatal bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mistletoe, which Lok the Accuser gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hoder, and unwitting Hoder threw threw&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Gainst that alone had Balder’s life no charm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a>{95}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all the gods and all the heroes came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood round Balder on the bloody floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping and wailing; and Valhalla rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to its golden roof with sobs and cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the tables stood the untasted meats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the horns and gold-rimmed sculls the wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now would night have fallen, and found them yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wailing; but otherwise was Odin’s will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the Father of the ages spake:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Enough of tears, ye gods, enough of wail!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to lament in was Valhalla made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any here might weep for Balder’s death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I most might weep, his father; such a son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lose to-day, so bright, so loved a god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he has met that doom which long ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Nornies, when his mother bare him, spun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fate set seal, that so his end must be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balder has met his death, and ye survive.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep him an hour, but what can grief avail?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ye yourselves, ye gods, shall meet your doom,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ye who hear me, and inhabit heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I too, Odin too, the lord of all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ours we shall not meet, when that day comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With women’s tears and weak complaining cries:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should we meet another’s portion so?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather it fits you, having wept your hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cold dry eyes, and hearts composed and stern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To live, as erst, your daily life in heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By me shall vengeance on the murderer Lok,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foe, the accuser, whom, though gods, we hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be strictly cared for, in the appointed day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, to-morrow, when the morning dawns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring wood to the seashore to Balder’s ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the deck build high a funeral pile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a>{96}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the top lay Balder’s corpse, and put<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire to the wood, and send him out to sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To burn; for that is what the dead desire.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So spake the king of gods, and straightway rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mounted his horse Sleipner, whom he rode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the hall of heaven he rode away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Lidskialf, and sate upon his throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mount, from whence his eye surveys the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far from heaven he turned his shining orbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look on Midgard, and the earth, and men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the conjuring Lapps he bent his gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom antlered reindeer pull over the snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the Finns, the gentlest of mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair men, who live in holes under the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did he look once more to Ida’s plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor toward Valhalla and the sorrowing gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For well he knew the gods would heed his word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cease to mourn, and think of Balder’s pyre.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But in Valhalla all the gods went back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From around Balder, all the heroes went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left his body stretched upon the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on their golden chairs they sate again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the tables, in the hall of heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And before each the cooks who served them placed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New messes of the boar Serimner’s flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Valkyries crowned their horns with mead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they, with pent-up hearts and tearless eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wailing no more, in silence ate and drank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While twilight fell, and sacred night came on.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the blind Hoder left the feasting gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Odin’s hall, and went through Asgard streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And past the haven where the gods have moored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their ships, and through the gate, beyond the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though sightless, yet his own mind led the god.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a>{97}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the margin of the roaring sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He came, and sadly went along the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the waves and black o’erhanging cliffs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in and out the screaming seafowl fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until he came to where a gully breaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the cliff-wall, and a fresh stream runs down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the high moors behind, and meets the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, in the glen, Fensaler stands, the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Frea, honored mother of the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shows its lighted windows to the main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he went up, and passed the open doors;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the hall he found those women old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prophetesses, who by rite eterne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Frea’s hearth feed high the sacred fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both night and day; and by the inner wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her golden chair the mother sate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With folded hands, revolving things to come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her drew Hoder near, and spake, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Mother, a child of bale thou bar’st in me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, first, thou barest me with blinded eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sightless and helpless, wandering weak in heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, after that, of ignorant witless mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou barest me, and unforeseeing soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I alone must take the branch from Lok,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foe, the accuser, whom, though gods, we hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast it at the dear-loved Balder’s breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At whom the gods in sport their weapons threw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Gainst that alone had Balder’s life no charm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now therefore what to attempt, or whither fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who will bear my hateful sight in heaven?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can I, O mother, bring them Balder back?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or&mdash;for thou know’st the fates, and things allowed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can I with Hela’s power a compact strike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make exchange, and give my life for his?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>{98}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke: the mother of the gods replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hoder, ill-fated, child of bale, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sightless in soul and eye, what words are these?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one, long portioned with his doom of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should change his lot, and fill another’s life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hela yield to this, and let him go!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Balder, Death hath laid her hand, not thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor doth she count this life a price for that.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many gods in heaven, not thou alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would freely die to purchase Balder back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wend themselves to Hela’s gloomy realm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not so gladsome is that life in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which gods and heroes lead, in feast and fray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting the darkness of the final times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one should grudge its loss for Balder’s sake,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balder their joy, so bright, so loved a god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fate withstands, and laws forbid this way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in my secret mind one way I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor do I judge if it shall win or fail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But much must still be tried, which shall but fail.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the blind Hoder answered her, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What way is this, O mother, that thou show’st?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it a matter which a god might try?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And straight the mother of the gods replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“There is a way which leads to Hela’s realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untrodden, lonely, far from light and heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who goes that way must take no other horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ride, but Sleipner, Odin’s horse, alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor must he choose that common path of gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which every day they come and go in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall’s watch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past Midgard fortress, down to earth and men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he must tread a dark untravelled road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which branches from the north of heaven, and ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a>{99}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through valleys deep-ingulfed with roaring streams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he will reach on the tenth morn a bridge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which spans with golden arches Giall’s stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Bifrost, but that bridge a damsel keeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who tells the passing troops of dead their way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the low shore of ghosts, and Hela’s realm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she will bid him northward steer his course.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he will journey through no lighted land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor see the sun arise, nor see it set;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he must ever watch the northern Bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from her frozen height with jealous eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confronts the Dog and Hunter in the south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is alone not dipt in ocean’s stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straight he will come down to ocean’s strand,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ocean, whose watery ring infolds the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on whose marge the ancient giants dwell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he will reach its unknown northern shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far, far beyond the outmost giant’s home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the chinked fields of ice, the wastes of snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he must fare across the dismal ice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Northward, until he meets a stretching wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barring his way, and in the wall a grate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then he must dismount, and on the ice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tighten the girths of Sleipner, Odin’s horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make him leap the grate, and come within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he will see stretch round him Hela’s realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plains of Niflheim, where dwell the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear the roaring of the streams of hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he will see the feeble, shadowy tribes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Balder sitting crowned, and Hela’s throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then must he not regard the wailful ghosts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who all will flit, like eddying leaves, around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he must straight accost their solemn queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>{100}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pay her homage, and entreat with prayers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Telling her all that grief they have in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Balder, whom she holds by right below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If haply he may melt her heart with words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make her yield, and give him Balder back.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spoke; but Hoder answered her and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Mother, a dreadful way is this thou show’st;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No journey for a sightless god to go!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And straight the mother of the gods replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Therefore thyself thou shalt not go, my son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he whom first thou meetest when thou com’st<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Asgard, and declar’st this hidden way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall go; and I will be his guide unseen.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke, and on her face let fall her veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowed her head, and sate with folded hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at the central hearth those women old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who while the mother spake had ceased their toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began again to heap the sacred fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hoder turned, and left his mother’s house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fensaler, whose lit windows look to sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came again down to the roaring waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And back along the beach to Asgard went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pondering on that which Frea said should be.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But night came down, and darkened Asgard streets.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from their loathèd feast the gods arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lighted torches, and took up the corpse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Balder from the floor of Odin’s hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid it on a bier, and bare him home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the fast-darkening streets to his own house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breidablik, on whose columns Balder graved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The enchantments that recall the dead to life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wise he was, and many curious arts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Postures of runes, and healing herbs he knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy! but that art he did not know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>{101}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep his own life safe, and see the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There to his hall the gods brought Balder home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each bespake him as he laid him down,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Would that ourselves, O Balder, we were borne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home to our halls, with torchlight, by our kin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thou might’st live, and still delight the gods!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They spake, and each went home to his own house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there was one, the first of all the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For speed, and Hermod was his name in heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most fleet he was, but now he went the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy in heart for Balder, to his house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he in Asgard built him, there to dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the harbor, by the city-wall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him the blind Hoder met, as he came up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the sea cityward, and knew his step;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet could Hermod see his brother’s face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it grew dark; but Hoder touched his arm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a spray of honeysuckle-flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brushes across a tired traveller’s face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shuffles through the deep dew-moistened dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a May evening, in the darkened lanes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And starts him, that he thinks a ghost went by,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Hoder brushed by Hermod’s side, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Take Sleipner, Hermod, and set forth with dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hela’s kingdom, to ask Balder back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they shall be thy guides, who have the power.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spake, and brushed soft by, and disappeared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hermod gazed into the night, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Who is it utters through the dark his best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So quickly, and will wait for no reply?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice was like the unhappy Hoder’s voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howbeit I will see, and do his hest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there rang note divine in that command.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So speaking, the fleet-footed Hermod came<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>{102}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home, and lay down to sleep in his own house;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the gods lay down in their own homes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hoder too came home, distraught with grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loathing to meet, at dawn, the other gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he went in, and shut the door, and fixed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sword upright, and fell on it, and died.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But from the hill of Lidskialf Odin rose,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throne from which his eye surveys the world,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mounted Sleipner, and in darkness rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Asgard. And the stars came out in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High over Asgard, to light home the king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fiercely Odin galloped, moved in heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swift to Asgard, to the gate, he came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And terribly the hoofs of Sleipner rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the flinty floor of Asgard streets;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gods trembled on their golden beds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing the wrathful Father coming home,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dread, for like a whirlwind, Odin came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Valhalla’s gate he rode, and left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleipner; and Sleipner went to his own stall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in Valhalla Odin laid him down.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But in Breidablik Nanna, Balder’s wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came with the goddesses who wrought her will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood by Balder lying on his bier.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at his head and feet she stationed scalds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in their lives were famous for their song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These o’er the corpse intoned a plaintive strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dirge,&mdash;and Nanna and her train replied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far into the night they wailed their dirge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when their souls were satisfied with wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They went, and laid them down, and Nanna went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into an upper chamber, and lay down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Frea sealed her tired lids with sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ’twas when night is bordering hard on dawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>{103}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When air is chilliest, and the stars sunk low;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Balder’s spirit through the gloom drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In garb, in form, in feature, as he was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alive; and still the rays were round his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which were his glorious mark in heaven; he stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over against the curtain of the bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gazed on Nanna as she slept, and spake,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Poor lamb, thou sleepest, and forgett’st thy woe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears stand upon the lashes of thine eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears wet the pillow by thy cheek; but thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a young child, hast cried thyself to sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep on; I watch thee, and am here to aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alive I kept not far from thee, dear soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither do I neglect thee now, though dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For with to-morrow’s dawn the gods prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gather wood, and build a funeral-pile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my ship, and burn my corpse with fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sad, sole honor of the dead; and thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They think to burn, and all my choicest wealth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me, for thus ordains the common rite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it shall not be so; but mild, but swift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But painless, shall a stroke from Frea come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cut thy thread of life, and free thy soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they shall burn thy corpse with mine, not thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well I know that by no stroke of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tardy or swift, wouldst thou be loath to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So it restored thee, Nanna, to my side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom thou so well hast loved; but I can smooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy way, and this, at least, my prayers avail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, and I fain would altogether ward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death from thy head, and with the gods in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prolong thy life, though not by thee desired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But right bars this, not only thy desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet dreary, Nanna, is the life they lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>{104}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that dim world, in Hela’s mouldering realm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doleful are the ghosts, the troops of dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Hela with austere control presides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For of the race of gods is no one there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save me alone, and Hela, solemn queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the nobler souls of mortal men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On battle-field have met their death, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feast in Valhalla, in my father’s hall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the inglorious sort are there below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old, the cowards, and the weak are there,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men spent by sickness, or obscure decay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But even there, O Nanna, we might find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some solace in each other’s look and speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering together through that gloomy world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And talking of the life we led in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we yet lived, among the other gods.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake, and straight his lineaments began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fade; and Nanna in her sleep stretched out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her arms towards him with a cry; but he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mournfully shook his head, and disappeared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the woodman sees a little smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hang in the air afield, and disappear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Balder faded in the night away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nanna on her bed sank back; but then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frea, the mother of the gods, with stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Painless and swift, set free her airy soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which took, on Balder’s track, the way below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And instantly the sacred morn appeared.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Forth</span> from the east, up the ascent of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day drove his courser with the shining mane;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>{105}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in Valhalla, from his gable-perch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden-crested cock began to crow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter, in the blackest dead of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shrill and dismal cries that bird shall crow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warning the gods that foes draw nigh to heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now he crew at dawn, a cheerful note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wake the gods and heroes to their tasks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the gods and all the heroes woke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from their beds the heroes rose, and donned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their arms, and led their horses from the stall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mounted them, and in Valhalla’s court<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were ranged; and then the daily fray began.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all day long they there are hacked and hewn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Mid dust, and groans, and limbs lopped off, and blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all at night return to Odin’s hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woundless and fresh: such lot is theirs in heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Valkyries on their steeds went forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward earth and fights of men; and at their side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skulda, the youngest of the Nornies, rode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over Bifrost, where is Heimdall’s watch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past Midgard fortress, down to earth they came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There through some battle-field, where men fall fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their horses fetlock-deep in blood, they ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pick the bravest warriors out for death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom they bring back with them at night to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To glad the gods, and feast in Odin’s hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the gods went not now, as otherwhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the tilt-yard, where the heroes fought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feast their eyes with looking on the fray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did they to their judgment-place repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the ash Igdrasil, in Ida’s plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where they hold council, and give laws for men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they went, Odin first, the rest behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a>{106}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the hall Gladheim, which is built of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where are in circle ranged twelve golden chairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the midst one higher, Odin’s throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There all the gods in silence sate them down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the Father of the ages spake:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Go quickly, gods, bring wood to the seashore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all which it beseems the dead to have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make a funeral-pile on Balder’s ship;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the twelfth day the gods shall burn his corpse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Hermod, thou take Sleipner, and ride down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hela’s kingdom, to ask Balder back.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So said he; and the gods arose, and took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Axes and ropes, and at their head came Thor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouldering his hammer, which the giants know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth wended they, and drave their steeds before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up the dewy mountain tracks they fared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the dark forests, in the early dawn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up and down, and side and slant they roamed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the glens all day an echo came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of crashing falls; for with his hammer Thor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote ’mid the rocks the lichen-bearded pines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And burst their roots, while to their tops the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made fast the woven ropes, and haled them down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lopped their boughs, and clove them on the sward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bound the logs behind their steeds to draw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drave them homeward; and the snorting steeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went straining through the crackling brushwood down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the darkling forest-paths the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed, and on their shoulders carried boughs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they came out upon the plain, and passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asgard, and led their horses to the beach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loosed them of their loads on the seashore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ranged the wood in stacks by Balder’s ship;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every god went home to his own house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>{107}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But when the gods were to the forest gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hermod led Sleipner from Valhalla forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saddled him: before that, Sleipner brooked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No meaner hand than Odin’s on his mane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his broad back no lesser rider bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet docile now he stood at Hermod’s side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arching his neck, and glad to be bestrode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing the god they went to seek, how dear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hermod mounted him, and sadly fared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence up the dark untravelled road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which branches from the north of heaven, and went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day; and daylight waned, and night came on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that night he rode, and journeyed so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through valleys deep-ingulfed, by roaring streams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the tenth morn he beheld the bridge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which spans with golden arches Giall’s stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the bridge a damsel watching armed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the strait passage, at the farther end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the road issues between walling rocks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scant space that warder left for passers-by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as when cowherds in October drive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their kine across a snowy mountain pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To winter pasture on the southern side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the ridge a wagon chokes the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wedged in the snow; then painfully the hinds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With goad and shouting urge their cattle past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunging through deep untrodden banks of snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To right and left, and warm steam fills the air,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So on the bridge that damsel blocked the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And questioned Hermod as he came, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Who art thou on thy black and fiery horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under whose hoofs the bridge o’er Giall’s stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rumbles and shakes? Tell me thy race and home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>{108}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yester-morn, five troops of dead passed by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound on their way below to Hela’s realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shook the bridge so much as thou alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou hast flesh and color on thy cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like men who live, and draw the vital air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor look’st thou pale and wan, like men deceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Souls bound below, my daily passers here.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the fleet-footed Hermod answered her,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O damsel, Hermod am I called, the son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Odin; and my high-roofed house is built<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far hence, in Asgard, in the city of gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sleipner, Odin’s horse, is this I ride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I come, sent this road on Balder’s track:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, then, if he hath crossed thy bridge or no?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake; the warder of the bridge replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O Hermod, rarely do the feet of gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or of the horses of the gods resound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my bridge; and, when they cross, I know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balder hath gone this way, and ta’en the road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below there, to the north, toward Hela’s realm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From here the cold white mist can be discerned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not lit with sun, but through the darksome air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the dim vapor-blotted light of stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which hangs over the ice where lies the road.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in that ice are lost those northern streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freezing and ridging in their onward flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which from the fountain of Vergelmer run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spring that bubbles up by Hela’s throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are the joyless seats, the haunt of ghosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hela’s pale swarms; and there was Balder bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ride on! pass free! but he by this is there.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spake, and stepped aside, and left him room.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hermod greeted her, and galloped by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the bridge; then she took post again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>{109}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But northward Hermod rode, the way below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er a darksome tract, which knows no sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by the blotted light of stars, he fared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he came down to ocean’s northern strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the drear ice, beyond the giants’ home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence on he journeyed o’er the fields of ice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still north, until he met a stretching wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barring his way, and in the wall a grate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he dismounted, and drew tight the girths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the smooth ice, of Sleipner, Odin’s horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made him leap the grate, and came within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he beheld spread round him Hela’s realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plains of Niflheim, where dwell the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the thunder of the streams of hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For near the wall the river of Roaring flows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outmost; the others near the centre run,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Storm, the Abyss, the Howling, and the Pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These flow by Hela’s throne, and near their spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the dark flocked up the shadowy tribes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the swallows crowd the bulrush-beds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some clear river, issuing from a lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On autumn-days, before they cross the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to each bulrush-crest a swallow hangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swinging, and others skim the river-streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their quick twittering fills the banks and shores,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So around Hermod swarmed the twittering ghosts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Women, and infants, and young men who died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too soon for fame, with white ungraven shields;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And old men, known to glory, but their star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrayed them, and of wasting age they died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not wounds; yet, dying, they their armor wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now have chief regard in Hela’s realm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind flocked wrangling up a piteous crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greeted of none, disfeatured and forlorn,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>{110}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cowards, who were in sloughs interred alive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round them still the wattled hurdles hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith they stamped them down, and trod them deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hide their shameful memory from men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all he passed unhailed, and reached the throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hela, and saw, near it, Balder crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hela set thereon, with countenance stern;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus bespake him first the solemn queen:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Unhappy, how hast thou endured to leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light, and journey to the cheerless land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where idly flit about the feeble shades?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How didst thou cross the bridge o’er Giall’s stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being alive, and come to ocean’s shore?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or how o’erleap the grate that bars the wall?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spake; but down off Sleipner Hermod sprang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell before her feet, and clasped her knees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake, and mild entreated her, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“O Hela, wherefore should the gods declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their errands to each other, or the ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They go? the errand and the way is known.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know’st, thou know’st, what grief we have in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Balder, whom thou hold’st by right below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restore him! for what part fulfils he here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he shed cheer over the cheerless seats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And touch the apathetic ghosts with joy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not for such end, O queen, thou hold’st thy realm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For heaven was Balder born, the city of gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heroes, where they live in light and joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither restore him, for his place is there!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; and grave replied the solemn queen,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hermod, for he thou art, thou son of heaven!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A strange unlikely errand, sure, is thine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>{111}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do the gods send to me to make them blest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small bliss my race hath of the gods obtained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three mighty children to my father Lok<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did Angerbode, the giantess, bring forth,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fenris the wolf, the serpent huge, and me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these the serpent in the sea ye cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who since in your despite hath waxed amain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now with gleaming ring infolds the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me on this cheerless nether world ye threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave me nine unlighted realms to rule;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on his island in the lake afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made fast to the bored crag, by wile not strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subdued, with limber chains lives Fenris bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lok still subsists in heaven, our father wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your mate, though loathed, and feasts in Odin’s hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But him too foes await, and netted snares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a cave a bed of needle-rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er his visage serpents dropping gall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he shall one day rise, and burst his bonds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with himself set us his offspring free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he guides Muspel’s children to their bourne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till then in peril or in pain we live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought by the gods&mdash;and ask the gods our aid?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howbeit, we abide our day: till then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We do not as some feebler haters do,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek to afflict our foes with petty pangs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helpless to better us, or ruin them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, then! if Balder was so dear beloved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is true, and such a loss is heaven’s,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear how to heaven may Balder be restored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show me through all the world the signs of grief!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fails but one thing to grieve, here Balder stops!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let all that lives and moves upon the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep him, and all that is without life weep;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>{112}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let gods, men, brutes, beweep him; plants and stones.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall I know the lost was dear indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bend my heart, and give him back to heaven.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spake; and Hermod answered her, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hela, such as thou say’st, the terms shall be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But come, declare me this, and truly tell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May I, ere I depart, bid Balder hail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or is it here withheld to greet the dead?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake; and straightway Hela answered him,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hermod, greet Balder if thou wilt, and hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Converse; his speech remains, though he be dead.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And straight to Balder Hermod turned, and spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Even in the abode of death, O Balder, hail!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hear’st, if hearing, like as speech, is thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The terms of thy releasement hence to heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear nothing but that all shall be fulfilled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not unmindful of thee are the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who see the light, and blest in Asgard dwell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even here they seek thee out, in Hela’s realm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sure, of all the happiest far art thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ever have been known in earth or heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alive, thou wast of gods the most beloved;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now thou sittest crowned by Hela’s side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, and hast honor among all the dead.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake; and Balder uttered him reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But feebly, as a voice far off; he said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Hermod the nimble, gild me not my death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better to live a serf, a captured man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who scatters rushes in a master’s hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than be a crowned king here, and rule the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I count not of these terms as safe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be fulfilled, nor my return as sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I be loved, and many mourn my death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For double-minded ever was the seed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a>{113}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Lok, and double are the gifts they give.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howbeit, report thy message; and therewith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Odin, to my father, take this ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memorial of me, whether saved or no;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell the heaven-born gods how thou hast seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me sitting here below by Hela’s side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowned, having honor among all the dead.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake, and raised his hand, and gave the ring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with inscrutable regard the queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hell beheld them, and the ghosts stood dumb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hermod took the ring, and yet once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kneeled and did homage to the solemn queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then mounted Sleipner, and set forth to ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back, through the astonished tribes of dead, to heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the wall he came, and found the grate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted, and issued on the fields of ice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er the ice he fared to ocean’s strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up from thence, a wet and misty road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the armed damsel’s bridge, and Giall’s stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worse was that way to go than to return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him: for others, all return is barred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine days he took to go, two to return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the twelfth morn saw the light of heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a traveller in the early dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the steep edge of some great valley comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which a river flows, and sees, beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clouds of white rolling vapors fill the vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But o’er them, on the farther slope, descries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vineyards, and crofts, and pastures, bright with sun,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Hermod, o’er the fog between, saw heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sleipner snorted, for he smelt the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven; and mightily, as winged, he flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hermod saw the towers of Asgard rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he drew near, and heard no living voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a>{114}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Asgard; and the golden halls were dumb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Hermod knew what labor held the gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the empty streets he rode, and passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the gate-house to the sands, and found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods on the seashore by Balder’s ship.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The</span> gods held talk together, grouped in knots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round Balder’s corpse, which they had thither borne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hermod came down towards them from the gate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lok, the father of the serpent, first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld him come, and to his neighbor spake,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“See, here is Hermod, who comes single back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hell; and shall I tell thee how he seems?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like as a farmer, who hath lost his dog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some morn, at market, in a crowded town,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through many streets the poor beast runs in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And follows this man after that, for hours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And late at evening, spent and panting, falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before a stranger’s threshold, not his home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flanks a-tremble, and his slender tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs quivering out between his dust-smeared jaws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And piteously he eyes the passers-by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But home his master comes to his own farm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far in the country, wondering where he is,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Hermod comes to-day unfollowed home.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And straight his neighbor, moved with wrath, replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Deceiver! fair in form, but false in heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enemy, mocker, whom, though gods, we hate,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace, lest our father Odin hear thee gibe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I might see him snatch thee in his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>{115}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bind thy carcass, like a bale, with cords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hurl thee in a lake, to sink or swim!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If clear from plotting Balder’s death, to swim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But deep, if thou devisedst it, to drown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perish, against fate, before thy day.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So they two soft to one another spake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Odin looked toward the land, and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His messenger; and he stood forth, and cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hermod came, and leapt from Sleipner down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his father’s hand put Sleipner’s rein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greeted Odin and the gods, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Odin, my father, and ye, gods of heaven!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, home, having performed your will, I come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the joyless kingdom have I been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below, and looked upon the shadowy tribes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ghosts, and communed with their solemn queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to your prayer she sends you this reply:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Show her through all the world the signs of grief!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fails but one thing to grieve, there Balder stops!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Let gods, men, brutes, beweep him; plants and stones.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>So shall she know your loss was dear indeed,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And bend her heart, and give you Balder back.</i>”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke, and all the gods to Odin looked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straight the Father of the ages said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Ye gods, these terms may keep another day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now put on your arms, and mount your steeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in procession all come near, and weep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balder; for that is what the dead desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ye enough have wept, then build a pile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the heaped wood, and burn his corpse with fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of our sight; that we may turn from grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lead, as erst, our daily life in heaven.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke, and the gods armed; and Odin donned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His dazzling corslet and his helm of gold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a>{116}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led the way on Sleipner; and the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed, in tears, their father and their king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice in arms around the dead they rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping; the sands were wetted, and their arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their thick-falling tears,&mdash;so good a friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They mourned that day, so bright, so loved a god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Odin came, and laid his kingly hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Balder’s breast, and thus began the wail:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Farewell, O Balder, bright and loved, my son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that great day, the twilight of the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Muspel’s children shall beleaguer heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then we shall miss thy counsel and thy arm.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou camest near the next, O warrior Thor!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouldering thy hammer, in thy chariot drawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swaying the long-haired goats with silvered rein;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over Balder’s corpse these words didst say:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Brother, thou dwellest in the darksome land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And talkest with the feeble tribes of ghosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, and I know not how they prize thee there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here, I know, thou wilt be missed and mourned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For haughty spirits and high wraths are rife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the gods and heroes here in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As among those whose joy and work is war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And daily strifes arise, and angry words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from thy lips, O Balder, night or day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard no one ever an injurious word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To god or hero, but thou keptest back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The others, laboring to compose their brawls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be ye then kind, as Balder too was kind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we lose him, who smoothed all strife in heaven.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake, and all the gods assenting wailed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Freya next came nigh, with golden tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loveliest goddess she in heaven, by all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most honored after Frea, Odin’s wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>{117}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her long ago the wandering Oder took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mate, but left her to roam distant lands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since then she seeks him, and weeps tears of gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Names hath she many; Vanadis on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call her, Freya is her name in heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She in her hands took Balder’s head, and spake,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Balder, my brother, thou art gone a road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown and long, and haply on that way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My long-lost wandering Oder thou hast met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in the paths of heaven he is not found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! if it be so, tell him what thou wast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his neglected wife, and what he is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wring his heart with shame, to hear thy word!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he, my husband, left me here to pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not long a wife, when his unquiet heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First drove him from me into distant lands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since then I vainly seek him through the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weep from shore to shore my golden tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But neither god nor mortal heeds my pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou only, Balder, wast forever kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take my hand, and wipe my tears, and say,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Weep not, O Freya, weep no golden tears!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>One day the wandering Oder will return,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or thou wilt find him in thy faithful search,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>On some great road, or resting in an inn,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or at a ford, or sleeping by a tree</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Balder said; but Oder, well I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My truant Oder I shall see no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the world’s end; and Balder now is gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am left uncomforted in heaven.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spake, and all the goddesses bewailed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last from among the heroes one came near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No god, but of the hero-troop the chief,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regner, who swept the northern sea with fleets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>{118}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruled o’er Denmark and the heathy isles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Living; but Ella captured him and slew,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A king, whose fame then filled the vast of heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now time obscures it, and men’s later deeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He last approached the corpse, and spake and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Balder, there yet are many scalds in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still left, and that chief scald, thy brother Brage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom we may bid to sing, though thou art gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all these gladly, while we drink, we hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the feast is done, in Odin’s hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they harp ever on one string, and wake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembrance in our soul of wars alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as on earth we valiantly have waged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blood, and ringing blows, and violent death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when thou sangest, Balder, thou didst strike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another note, and, like a bird in spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy voice of joyance minded us, and youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wife, and children, and our ancient home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, and I too remembered then no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My dungeon, where the serpents stung me dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Ella’s victory on the English coast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I heard Thora laugh in Gothland Isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw my shepherdess, Aslauga, tend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her flock along the white Norwegian beach.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears started to mine eyes with yearning joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore with grateful heart I mourn thee dead.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So Regner spake, and all the heroes groaned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the sun had passed the height of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon had all that day been spent in wail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then the Father of the ages said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Ye gods, there well may be too much of wail!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring now the gathered wood to Balder’s ship;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heap on the deck the logs, and build the pyre.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when the gods and heroes heard, they brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>{119}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wood to Balder’s ship, and built a pile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full the deck’s breadth, and lofty; then the corpse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Balder on the highest top they laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Nanna on his right, and on his left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoder, his brother, whom his own hand slew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they set jars of wine and oil to lean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the bodies, and stuck torches near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Splinters of pine-wood, soaked with turpentine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought his arms and gold, and all his stuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slew the dogs who at his table fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his horse, Balder’s horse, whom most he loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And threw them on the pyre; and Odin threw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A last choice gift thereon, his golden ring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mast they fixed, and hoisted up the sails;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they put fire to the wood; and Thor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set his stout shoulder hard against the stern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To push the ship through the thick sand; sparks flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the deep trench she ploughed, so strong a god<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furrowed it; and the water gurgled in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ship floated on the waves, and rocked.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the hills a strong east-wind arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came down moaning to the sea; first squalls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran black o’er the sea’s face, then steady rushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breeze, and filled the sails, and blew the fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wreathed in smoke the ship stood out to sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon with a roaring rose the mighty fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pile crackled; and between the logs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp quivering tongues of flame shot out, and leapt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curling and darting, higher, until they licked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summit of the pile, the dead, the mast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ate the shrivelling sails; but still the ship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drove on, ablaze above her hull with fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gods stood upon the beach, and gazed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while they gazed, the sun went lurid down<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a>{120}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the smoke-wrapt sea, and night came on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the wind fell, with night, and there was calm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But through the dark they watched the burning ship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still carried o’er the distant waters on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farther and farther, like an eye of fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long, in the far dark, blazed Balder’s pile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fainter, as the stars rose high, it flared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bodies were consumed, ash choked the pile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as, in a decaying winter-fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A charred log, falling, makes a shower of sparks,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So with a shower of sparks the pile fell in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reddening the sea around; and all was dark.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the gods went by starlight up the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Asgard, and sate down in Odin’s hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At table, and the funeral-feast began.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night they ate the boar Serimner’s flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from their horns, with silver rimmed, drank mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent, and waited for the sacred morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And morning over all the world was spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from their loathèd feast the gods arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took their horses, and set forth to ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall’s watch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the ash Igdrasil, and Ida’s plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thor came on foot, the rest on horseback rode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they found Mimir sitting by his fount<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wisdom, which beneath the ash-tree springs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw the Nornies watering the roots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that world-shadowing tree with honey-dew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came the gods, and sate them down on stones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the Father of the ages said:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Ye gods, the terms ye know, which Hermod brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accept them or reject them! both have grounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accept them, and they bind us, unfulfilled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a>{121}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave forever Balder in the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unrecovered prisoner, shade with shades.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how, ye say, should the fulfilment fail?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth sound the terms, and light to be fulfilled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dear-beloved was Balder while he lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven and earth, and who would grudge him tears?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from the traitorous seed of Lok they come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These terms, and I suspect some hidden fraud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bethink ye, gods, is there no other way?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak, were not this a way, the way for gods,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I, if Odin, clad in radiant arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mounted on Sleipner, with the warrior Thor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn in his car beside me, and my sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the strong brood of heaven, to swell my train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should make irruption into Hela’s realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set the fields of gloom ablaze with light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring in triumph Balder back to heaven?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake, and his fierce sons applauded loud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Frea, mother of the gods, arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter and wife of Odin; thus she said:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Odin, thou whirlwind, what a threat is this!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou threatenest what transcends thy might, even thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For of all powers the mightiest far art thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord over men on earth, and gods in heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet even from thee thyself hath been withheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One thing,&mdash;to undo what thou thyself hast ruled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all which hath been fixed was fixed by thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the beginning, ere the gods were born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the heavens were builded, thou didst slay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giant Ymir, whom the abyss brought forth,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou and thy brethren fierce, the sons of Bor,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast his trunk to choke the abysmal void.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of his flesh and members thou didst build<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth and ocean, and above them heaven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>{122}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the flaming world, where Muspel reigns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou sent’st and fetchedst fire, and madest lights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sun, moon, and stars, which thou hast hung in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dividing clear the paths of night and day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Asgard thou didst build, and Midgard fort;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then me thou mad’st; of us the gods were born.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last, walking by the sea, thou foundest spars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wood, and framedst men, who till the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or on the sea, the field of pirates, sail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the race of Ymir thou didst drown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save one, Bergelmer: he on shipboard fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy deluge, and from him the giants sprang.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all that brood thou hast removed far off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set by ocean’s utmost marge to dwell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hela into Niflheim thou threw’st,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gav’st her nine unlighted worlds to rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A queen, and empire over all the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That empire wilt thou now invade, light up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her darkness, from her grasp a subject tear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Try it; but I, for one, will not applaud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor do I merit, Odin, thou shouldst slight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me and my words, though thou be first in heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I too am a goddess, born of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine eldest, and of me the gods are sprung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that is to come I know, but lock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mine own breast, and have to none revealed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, then! since Hela holds by right her prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But offers terms for his release to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accept the chance: thou canst no more obtain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Send through the world thy messengers; entreat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All living and unliving things to weep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Balder: if thou haply thus may’st melt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hela, and win the loved one back to heaven.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>{123}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spake, and on her face let fall her veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowed her head, and sate with folded hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did the all-ruling Odin slight her word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straightway he spake, and thus addressed the gods:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Go quickly forth through all the world, and pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All living and unliving things to weep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balder, if haply he may thus be won.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the gods heard, they straight arose, and took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their horses, and rode forth through all the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">North, south, east, west, they struck, and roamed the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entreating all things to weep Balder’s death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that lived, and all without life, wept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as in winter, when the frost breaks up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At winter’s end, before the spring begins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a warm west-wind blows, and thaw sets in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After an hour a dripping sound is heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the forests, and the soft-strewn snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the trees is dibbled thick with holes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the boughs the snow-loads shuffle down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in fields sloping to the south, dark plots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grass peep out amid surrounding snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And widen, and the peasant’s heart is glad,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So through the world was heard a dripping noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all things weeping to bring Balder back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there fell joy upon the gods to hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Hermod rode with Niord, whom he took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To show him spits and beaches of the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off, where some unwarned might fail to weep,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Niord, the god of storms, whom fishers know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not born in heaven, he was in Vanheim reared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With men, but lives a hostage with the gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows each frith, and every rocky creek<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>{124}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fringed with dark pines, and sands where seafowl scream,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They two scoured every coast, and all things wept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they rode home together, through the wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Jarnvid, which to east of Midgard lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bordering the giants, where the trees are iron;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the wood before a cave they came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sate, in the cave’s mouth, a skinny hag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toothless and old; she gibes the passers-by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thok is she called, but now Lok wore her shape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She greeted them the first, and laughed, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Ye gods, good lack, is it so dull in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye come pleasuring to Thok’s iron wood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lovers of change ye are, fastidious sprites.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look, as in some boor’s yard a sweet-breathed cow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose manger is stuffed full of good fresh hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snuffs at it daintily, and stoops her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To chew the straw, her litter, at her feet,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ye grow squeamish, gods, and sniff at heaven!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spake; but Hermod answered her, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Thok, not for gibes we come, we come for tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balder is dead, and Hela holds her prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But will restore if all things give him tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begrudge not thine! to all was Balder dear.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, with a louder laugh, the hag replied,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Is Balder dead? and do ye come for tears?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thok with dry eyes will weep o’er Balder’s pyre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep him all other things, if weep they will:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I weep him not! let Hela keep her prey.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spake, and to the cavern’s depth she fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mocking; and Hermod knew their toil was vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as seafaring men, who long have wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the great deep for gain, at last come home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And towards evening see the headlands rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>{125}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their dear country, and can plain descry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fire of withered furze which boys have lit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the cliffs, or smoke of burning weeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of a tilled field inland: then the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catches them, and drives out again to sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they go long days tossing up and down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the gray sea-ridges, and the glimpse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of port they had makes bitterer far their toil,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the gods’ cross was bitterer for their joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, sad at heart, to Niord Hermod spake,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“It is the accuser Lok, who flouts us all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ride back, and tell in heaven this heavy news;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must again below, to Hela’s realm.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke, and Niord set forth back to heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But northward Hermod rode, the way below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way he knew; and traversed Giall’s stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down to ocean groped, and crossed the ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came beneath the wall, and found the grate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still lifted: well was his return foreknown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once more Hermod saw around him spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joyless plains, and heard the streams of hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as he entered, on the extremest bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Niflheim, he saw one ghost come near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hovering, and stopping oft, as if afraid,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoder, the unhappy, whom his own hand slew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hermod looked, and knew his brother’s ghost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called him by his name, and sternly said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Hoder, ill-fated, blind in heart and eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why tarriest thou to plunge thee in the gulf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the deep inner gloom, but flittest here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In twilight, on the lonely verge of hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the other ghosts, and Hela’s throne?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubtless thou fearest to meet Balder’s voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy brother, whom through folly thou didst slay.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>{126}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke; but Hoder answered him, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hermod the nimble, dost thou still pursue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unhappy with reproach, even in the grave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this I died, and fled beneath the gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not daily to endure abhorring gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor with a hateful presence cumber heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And canst thou not, even here, pass pitying by?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No less than Balder have I lost the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven, and communion with my kin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I too had once a wife, and once a child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And substance, and a golden house in heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all I left of my own act, and fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below; and dost thou hate me even here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balder upbraids me not, nor hates at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he has cause, have any cause; but he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that with downcast looks I hither came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched forth his hand, and with benignant voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Welcome</i>, he said, <i>if there be welcome here,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Brother and fellow-sport of Lok with me!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not to offend thee, Hermod, nor to force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hated converse on thee, came I up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the deep gloom, where I will now return;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But earnestly I longed to hover near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not too far off, when that thou camest by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feel the presence of a brother god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear the passage of a horse of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the last time&mdash;for here thou com’st no more.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake, and turned to go to the inner gloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hermod stayed him with mild words, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Thou doest well to chide me, Hoder blind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truly thou say’st, the planning guilty mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Lok’s: the unwitting hand alone was thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But gods are like the sons of men in this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they have woe, they blame the nearest cause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a>{127}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howbeit stay, and be appeased; and tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits Balder still in pomp by Hela’s side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or is he mingled with the unnumbered dead?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the blind Hoder answered him and spake,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“His place of state remains by Hela’s side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But empty; for his wife, for Nanna, came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lately below, and joined him; and the pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frequent the still recesses of the realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hela, and hold converse undisturbed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they too, doubtless, will have breathed the balm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which floats before a visitant from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have drawn upward to this verge of hell.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake; and, as he ceased, a puff of wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled heavily the leaden mist aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round where they stood, and they beheld two forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make toward them o’er the stretching cloudy plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hermod straight perceived them, who they were,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balder and Nanna; and to Balder said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Balder, too truly thou foresaw’st a snare!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lok triumphs still, and Hela keeps her prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more to Asgard shalt thou come, nor lodge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thy own house Breidablik, nor enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love all bear toward thee, nor train up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forset, thy son, to be beloved like thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here must thou lie, and wait an endless age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore for the last time, O Balder, hail!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake; and Balder answered him, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hail and farewell! for here thou com’st no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet mourn not for me, Hermod, when thou sitt’st<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven, nor let the other gods lament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As wholly to be pitied, quite forlorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Nanna hath rejoined me, who of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven, was seldom parted from my side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the acceptance follows me, which crowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a>{128}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My former life, and cheers me even here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The iron frown of Hela is relaxed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I draw nigh, and the wan tribes of dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love me, and gladly bring for my award<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their ineffectual feuds and feeble hates,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadows of hates, but they distress them still.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the fleet-footed Hermod made reply,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Thou hast, then, all the solace death allows,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Esteem and function; and so far is well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet here thou liest, Balder, underground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rusting forever; and the years roll on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The generations pass, the ages grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring us nearer to the final day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the south shall march the fiery band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cross the bridge of heaven, with Lok for guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fenris at his heel with broken chain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While from the east the giant Rymer steers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ship, and the great serpent makes to land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all are marshalled in one flaming square<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the gods, upon the plains of heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mourn thee, that thou canst not help us then.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake; but Balder answered him, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Mourn not for me! Mourn, Hermod, for the gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mourn for the men on earth, the gods in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who live, and with their eyes shall see that day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day will come, when fall shall Asgard’s towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Odin, and his sons, the seed of heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what were I, to save them in that hour?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If strength might save them, could not Odin save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father, and his pride, the warrior Thor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vidar the silent, the impetuous Tyr?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, what were I, when these can naught avail?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, doubtless, when the day of battle comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the two hosts are marshalled, and in heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a>{129}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden-crested cock shall sound alarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his black brother-bird from hence reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bucklers clash, and spears begin to pour,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longing will stir within my breast, though vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not to me so grievous as, I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To other gods it were, is my enforced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Absence from fields where I could nothing aid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I am long since weary of your storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of carnage, and find, Hermod, in your life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something too much of war and broils, which make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life one perpetual fight, a bath of blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine eyes are dizzy with the arrowy hail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine ears are stunned with blows, and sick for calm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inactive therefore let me lie, in gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unarmed, inglorious; I attend the course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ages, and my late return to light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In times less alien to a spirit mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In new-recovered seats, the happier day.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake, and the fleet Hermod thus replied:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Brother, what seats are these, what happier day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, that I may ponder it when gone.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the ray-crownèd Balder answered him,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Far to the south, beyond the blue, there spreads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another heaven, the boundless. No one yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath reached it. There hereafter shall arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second Asgard, with another name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither, when o’er this present earth and heavens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tempest of the latter days hath swept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they from sight have disappeared and sunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall a small remnant of the gods repair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoder and I shall join them from the grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There re-assembling we shall see emerge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the bright ocean at our feet an earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More fresh, more verdant than the last, with fruits<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a>{130}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Self-springing, and a seed of man preserved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who then shall live in peace, as now in war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we in heaven shall find again with joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruined palaces of Odin, seats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar, halls where we have supped of old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Re-enter them with wonder, never fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our eyes with gazing, and rebuild with tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we shall tread once more the well-known plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ida, and among the grass shall find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden dice wherewith we played of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that will bring to mind the former life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pastime of the gods, the wise discourse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Odin, the delights of other days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Hermod, pray that thou may’st join us then!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such for the future is my hope; meanwhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rest the thrall of Hela, and endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, and the gloom which round me even now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thickens, and to its inner gulf recalls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, for longer speech is not allowed!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spoke, and waved farewell, and gave his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Nanna; and she gave their brother blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand, in turn, for guidance; and the three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Departed o’er the cloudy plain, and soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faded from sight into the interior gloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hermod stood beside his drooping horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mute, gazing after them in tears; and fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fain had he followed their receding steps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though they to death were bound, and he to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then: but a power he could not break withheld.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a stork which idle boys have trapped,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of veined white-gleaming quartz, and here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dotted with holly-trees and juniper.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the smooth centre of the opening stood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fell-fares and the speckled missel-thrush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of their glossy coverts; but when now<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Under the feathered hats of the sweet pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In blinding masses showered the golden hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Iseult called them to her, and the three<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From Iseult’s lips the unbroken story flowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the children listened, their blue eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed on their mother’s face in wide surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a>{152}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did their looks stray once to the sea-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to the brown heaths round them, bright and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to the snow, which, though ’twas all away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the open heath, still by the hedgerows lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to the shining sea-fowl, that with screams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore up from where the bright Atlantic gleams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swooping to landward; nor to where, quite clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fell-fares settled on the thickets near.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they would still have listened, till dark night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came keen and chill down on the heather bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the red glow on the sea grew cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gray turrets of the castle old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked sternly through the frosty evening-air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Iseult took by the hand those children fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought her tale to an end, and found the path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led them home over the darkening heath.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And is she happy? Does she see unmoved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The days in which she might have lived and loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slip without bringing bliss slowly away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One after one, to-morrow like to-day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joy has not found her yet, nor ever will:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it this thought which makes her mien so still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her features so fatigued, her eyes, though sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sunk, so rarely lifted save to meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her children’s? She moves slow; her voice alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath yet an infantine and silver tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But even that comes languidly; in truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seems one dying in a mask of youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now she will go home, and softly lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her laughing children in their beds, and play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A while with them before they sleep; and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She’ll light her silver lamp,&mdash;which fishermen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragging their nets through the rough waves afar,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hour after hour, her gold curls sweeping it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting her soft-bent head only to mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her children, or to listen to the wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the clock peals midnight, she will move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her work away, and let her fingers rove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the shaggy brows of Tristram’s hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lies, guarding her feet, along the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else she will fall musing, her blue eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed, her slight hands clasped on her lap; then rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at her prie-dieu kneel, until she have told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her rosary-beads of ebony tipped with gold;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They sate them down together, and a sleep<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her finger on her lips, then Vivian rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from her brown-locked head the wimple throws,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The land of Ariosto showed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, e’en there, the canvas glowed<br /></span>

<i>Saw The Wide Prospect, and the Asian Fen.</i>
</p><p>
The name Europe (Εὐρώπη, <i>the wide prospect</i>) probably describes the
appearance of the European coast to the Greeks on the coast of Asia
Minor opposite. The name Asia, again, comes, it has been thought, from
the muddy fens of the rivers of Asia Minor, such as the Cayster or
Mæander, which struck the imagination of the Greeks living near them.</p></div>

<i>Sohrab and Rustum.</i>
</p><p>
The story of Sohrab and Rustum is told in Sir John Malcolm’s “History of
Persia,” as follows:&mdash;
</p><p>
“The young Sohrab was the fruit of one of Rustum’s early amours. He had
left his mother, and sought fame under the banners of Afrasiab, whose
armies he commanded; and soon obtained a renown beyond that of all
contemporary heroes but his father. He had carried death and dismay into
the ranks of the Persians, and had terrified the boldest warriors of
that country, before Rustum encountered him, which at last that hero
resolved to do under a feigned name. They met three times. The first
time, they parted by mutual consent, though Sohrab had the advantage;
the second, the youth obtained a victory, but granted life to his
unknown father; the third was fatal to Sohrab, who, when writhing in the
pangs of death, warned his conqueror to shun the vengeance that is
inspired by parental woes, and bade him dread the rage of the mighty
Rustum, who must soon learn that he had slain his son Sohrab. These
words, we are told, were as death to the aged hero; and when he
recovered from a trance, he called in despair for proofs of what Sohrab
had said. The afflicted and dying youth tore open his mail, and showed
his father a seal which his mother had placed on his arm when she
discovered to him the secret of his birth, and bade him seek his father.
The sight of his own signet rendered Rustum quite frantic: he cursed
himself, attempting to put an end to his existence, and was only
prevented by the efforts of his expiring son. After Sohrab’s death, he
burned his tents and all his goods, and carried the corpse to Seistan,
where it was interred; the army of Turan was, agreeably to the last
request of Sohrab, permitted to cross the Oxus unmolested. To reconcile
us to the improbability of this tale, we are informed that Rustum could
have no idea his son was in existence. The mother of Sohrab had written
to him her child was a daughter, fearing to lose her darling infant if
she revealed the truth; and Rustum, as before stated, fought under a
feigned name, an usage not uncommon in the chivalrous combats of those
days.”</p></div>

<i>Balder Dead.</i>
</p><p>
“Balder the Good having been tormented with terrible dreams, indicating
that his life was in great peril, communicated them to the assembled
Æsir, who resolved to conjure all things to avert from him the
threatened danger. Then Frigga exacted an oath from fire and water, from
iron and all other metals, as well as from stones, earths, diseases,
beasts, birds, poisons, and creeping things, that none of them would do
any harm to Balder. When this was done, it became a favorite pastime of
the Æsir, at their meetings, to get Balder to stand up and serve them as
a mark, some hurling darts at him, some stones, while others hewed at
him with their swords and battle-axes; for, do they what they would,
none of them could harm him, and this was regarded by all as a great
honor shown to Balder. But when Loki beheld the scene, he was sorely
vexed that Balder was not hurt. Assuming, therefore, the shape of a
woman, he went to Fensalir, the mansion of Frigga. That goddess, when
she saw the pretended woman, inquired of her if she knew what the Æsir
were doing at their meetings. She replied, that they were throwing darts
and stones at Balder without being able to hurt him.
</p><p>
“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Ay,’ said Frigga, ’neither metal nor wood can hurt Balder, for I have
exacted an oath from all of them.’
</p><p>
“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>What!’ exclaimed the woman, ‘have all things sworn to spare Balder?’
</p><p>
“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>All things,’ replied Frigga, ‘except one little shrub that grows on
the eastern side of Valhalla, and is called Mistletoe, and which I
thought too young and feeble to crave an oath from.’
</p><p>
“As soon as Loki heard this, he went away, and, resuming his natural
shape, cut off the mistletoe, and repaired to the place where the gods
were assembled. There he found Hödur standing apart, without partaking
of the sports, on account of his blindness; and going up to him said,
‘Why dost thou not also throw something at Balder?’<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_364" id="page_364"></a>{364}</span> “<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Because I am
blind,’ answered Hödur, ‘and see not where Balder is, and have,
moreover, nothing to throw with.’
</p><p>
“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Come, then,’ said Loki, ‘do like the rest, and show honor to Balder by
throwing this twig at him, and I will direct thy arm toward the place
where he stands.’
</p><p>
“Hödur then took the mistletoe, and, under the guidance of Loki, darted

<i>Tristram and Iseult.</i>
</p><p>
“In the court of his uncle King Marc, the king of Cornwall, who at this
time resided at the castle of Tyntagel, Tristram became expert in all
knightly exercises. The king of Ireland, at Tristram’s solicitations,
promised to bestow his daughter Iseult in marriage on King Marc. The
mother of Iseult gave to her daughter’s confidante a philtre, or
love-potion, to be administered on the night of her nuptials. Of this
beverage Tristram and Iseult, on their voyage to Cornwall, unfortunately
partook. Its influence, during the remainder of their lives, regulated
the affections and destiny of the lovers.
</p><p>
“After the arrival of Tristram and Iseult in Cornwall, and the nuptials
of the latter with King Marc, a great part of the romance is occupied
with their contrivances to procure secret interviews.&mdash;Tristram, being
forced to leave Cornwall on account of the displeasure of his uncle,
repaired to Brittany, where lived Iseult with the White Hands. He
married her, more out of gratitude than love. Afterwards he proceeded to
the dominions of Arthur, which became the theatre of unnumbered
exploits.
</p><p>
“Tristram, subsequent to these events, returned to Brittany, and to his
long-neglected wife. There, being wounded and sick, he was soon reduced
to the lowest ebb. In this situation, he dispatched a confidant to the
queen of Cornwall, to try if he could induce her to accompany him to
Brittany,” etc.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dunlop’s</span> <i>History of Fiction</i>.</p></div>

<i>The Scholar-Gypsy.</i>
</p><p>
“There was very lately a lad in the University of Oxford, who was by his
poverty forced to leave his studies there; and at last to join himself
to a company of vagabond gypsies. Among these extravagant people, by the
insinuating subtilty of his carriage, he quickly got so much of their
love and esteem as that they discovered to him their mystery. After he
had been a pretty while exercised in the trade, there chanced to ride by
a couple of scholars, who had formerly been of his acquaintance. They
quickly spied out their old friend among the gypsies; and he gave them
an account of the necessity which drove him to that kind of life, and
told them that the people he went with were not such impostors as they
were taken for, but that they had a traditional kind of learning among
them, and could do wonders by the power of imagination, their fancy
binding that of others; that himself had learned much of their art, and
when he had compassed the whole secret, he intended, he said, to leave
their company, and give the world an account of what he had
learned.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Glanvil’s</span> <i>Vanity of Dogmatizing</i>, 1661.</p></div>

<i>Young Daphnis with his silver voice doth sing.</i>
</p><p>
Daphnis, the ideal Sicilian shepherd of Greek pastoral poetry, was said
to have followed into Phrygia his mistress Piplea, who had been carried
off by robbers, and to have found her in the power of the king of
Phrygia, Lityerses. Lityerses used to make strangers try a contest with
him in reaping corn, and to put them to death if he overcame them.
Hercules arrived in time to save Daphnis, took upon himself the
reaping-contest with Lityerses, overcame him, and slew him. The
Lityerses-song connected with this tradition was, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_367" id="page_367"></a>{367}</span> Linus-song,
one of the early plaintive strains of Greek popular poetry, and used to
be sung by corn-reapers. Other traditions represented Daphnis as beloved
by a nymph who exacted from him an oath to love no one else. He fell in
love with a princess, and was struck blind by the jealous nymph.
Mercury, who was his father, raised him to heaven, and made a fountain
spring up in the place from which he ascended. At this fountain the
Sicilians offered yearly sacrifices. See <span class="smcap">Servius</span>, <i>Comment. in Virgil.

</p><p>
The author of <i>Obermann</i>, Étienne Pivert de Senancour, has little
celebrity in France, his own country; and out of France he is almost
unknown. But the profound inwardness, the austere sincerity, of his
principal work, <i>Obermann</i>, the delicate feeling for nature which it
exhibits, and the melancholy eloquence of many passages of it, have
attracted and charmed some of the most remarkable spirits of this
century, such as George Sand and Sainte-Beuve, and will probably always
find a certain number of spirits whom they touch and interest.
</p><p>
Senancour was born in 1770. He was educated for the priesthood, and
passed some time in the Seminary of St. Sulpice; broke away from the
seminary and from France itself, and passed some years in Switzerland,
where he married; returned to France in middle life, and followed
thenceforward the career of a man of letters, but with hardly any fame
or success. He died an old man in 1846, desiring that on his grave might
be placed these words only: <i>Éternité, deviens mon asile!</i>
</p><p>
The influence of Rousseau, and certain affinities with more famous and
fortunate authors of his own day,&mdash;Chateaubriand and Madame de
Staël,&mdash;are everywhere visible in Senancour. But though, like these
eminent personages, he may be called a sentimental writer, and though
<i>Obermann</i>, a collection of letters from Switzerland treating almost
entirely of nature and of the human soul, may be called a work of
sentiment, Senancour has a gravity and severity which distinguish him
from all other writers of the sentimental school. The world is with him
in his solitude far less than it is with them; of all writers, he is the
most perfectly isolated and the least attitudinizing. His chief work,
too, has a value and power of its own, apart from these merits of its
author. The stir of all the main forces by which modern life is and has
been impelled lives in the letters of <i>Obermann</i>; the dissolving
agencies of the eighteenth century, the fiery storm of the French
Revolution, the first faint promise and dawn of that new world which our
own time is but now fully bringing to light,&mdash;all these are to be felt,
almost to be touched, there. To me, indeed, it will always seem that the
impressiveness of this production can hardly be rated too high.
</p><p>
Besides <i>Obermann</i>, there is one other of Senancour’s works which, for
those spirits who feel his attraction, is very interesting: its title is
<i>Libres Méditations d’un Solitaire Inconnu</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_369" id="page_369"></a>{369}</span></p></div>

beautiful path over the Col de Jaman, followed by so many
foot-travellers on their way from Vevey to the Simmenthal and Thun.</p></div>

<p>The illustrations for these volumes are deserving of especial mention,
having been prepared at great expense, a large proportion of them
engraved by Geo. T. Andrew, whose work on “The Cambridge Book of Poetry”
adds so much to its value.</p>

<p>The paper, printing, and binding are also first-class in all respects,
and no effort has been spared to make this series attractive and
popular.</p>

<p>The price has also been fixed at a low rate, in order to insure the
favor of the public; and it is hoped that this line of Poets will prove
adapted to the wants of those desiring attractive books at popular
prices.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
